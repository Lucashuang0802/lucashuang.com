<p>I have been in iOS development for two full years and there are something you might want to keep in mind for making your app easier to <strong>DEVELOP </strong>and<strong> EXTEND</strong>. This post will be updated if there are many more in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>General:
<ul>
<li>Organize your file structure under actual folder as well as Project Navigator in Xcode. Your coworkers will find it easier to understand the code responsibility.</li>
<li>Do spend some time to research whether some complex functionalities have convenient and meaningful third-parties to accelerate development process but DO NOT overuse or use less reliable frameworks.</li>
<li>Take advantage of code snippets provided by Xcode and create your own convenient code snippets for future development. Your own codebase is highly recommended!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UI-Layout:
<ul>
<li>If you use a storyboard, try to split view controllers based on modules or responsibilities. Like, you can move all view controllers belonging to user management to a specific area etc. Also, including XIB files is accepted if it will make the project modular. You can split it into multi storyboards from iOS9.</li>
<li>Use <em>UIViewController</em> with <em>UITableView</em> instead of <em>UITableViewController</em> so that you have the flexibility to change UI elements inside this <em>UIViewController</em>. There has a great article talking about this issue: <a href="https://www.objc.io/issues/1-view-controllers/containment-view-controller/" target="_blank">Containment-View-Controller</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Coding:
<ul>
<li>The naming convention has to be unified or taken good care in a specific manner so that your coworkers know what it does and its purpose.</li>
<li>Create a file to handle key string and declare it as constant so that you can take advantage of auto-completion and avoid the typo. For instances, reuseIdentifier or segue identifier etc.</li>
<li>Try to create your model classes just like creating library's APIs and consider critically what you should expose or not. For example, take advantage of public and private header declaration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Codes management:
<ul>
<li>Get used to composing useful comments as well as git comments and sticking with clean coding style like the one from <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/objective-c-style-guide" target="_blank">NYTimes Objective-C Style Guide</a>.</li>
<li>Always filter out unnecessary lines inside a file or files when committing like <em>.xcuserstate</em>, <em>.xcbkptlist </em>because your coworkers do not necessarily to have these files.</li>
<li>Take advantage of GUI tool like <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/" target="_blank">SourceTree</a> if you are not familiar with git command</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These hints are my personal experience that will probably help you to reduce your time in iOS development. I have tried to finish a client app for two days ONLY. Hopefully, this will be helpful. Leave comments below and let's share what other iOS developers think.</p>
