<p>I have been asked by iOS folks, interviewers even clients about my perspective of using Swift in projects now. I got credits simply because I have been rolling in iOS development for four years. I am glad of being able to give some insides.</p>
<p>Let's get started with my Swift experience. Well, I worked on two projects written in pure Swift. That's enough to get me to learn the syntax of Swift and its characteristic. Besides, I also mixed and matched Swift in couples Objective-C projects that were launched in App Store successfully. That gets me understand the principle of how Swift and Objective-C work together. I might not be capable of discussing too many technical details behind these two languages. But, I will share with you why I started using Swift from project and programming language standpoint since the first version. Oh yeah, I think mixing two of them should be the best at least for the next three years.</p>
<h2>Objective-C is stable</h2>
<p>First of all, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C" target="_blank">Objective-C</a> is stable with no doubt. It's 33 years old now! I think nobody will say Swift is better than that from the stability? Comment below if so and let's find out. The evolution of Objective-C is sort of slow. Apple introduced Objective-C 2.0 in 2007. Why? Because it's already that stable. Why bother to change? It just got changed if necessary. Whereas Swift got changes constantly starting from August 2014, the time when Swift 1.0 got released. Newer beta Swift does not seem to stop coming out after Swift 2 got released in WWDC 2015. It can tell that Swift is relatively unstable compared to our legend. Purely using it in a project might be problematic and I don't think engineers will release their software using a beta version of Swift? It seems that Objective-C is more reliable to use for consumer-facing products.</p>
<h2>Swift is Swifty</h2>
<p>Undeniable, Swift is much better than Objective-C. From the syntax perspective, it's cleaner, less typing and modern. For example, you don't need @ symbol anymore. That's just for Objective-C differentiating keywords and types from C language. Besides, you don't need to be in the bracket hell. By the way, you don't need the semicolon either. Isn't it such a good way to change the developer world? Furthermore, Swift is a much safer language. Swift is less likely to crash in runtime due to the introduction of Optional Type. There are a lot of improper use of language and API call can be detected by compiler level. That's why Swift is also known as a static programming language. Anyway, there are a lot more reasons to indicate that Swift is going to be huge in the future like its speed. In short, you just can't leave Swift behind.</p>
<p>Being a developer, it's great if you put Swift into your toolchain. Believe it or not, Swift is open source now. Check this out: <a href="https://swift.org/" target="_blank">Swift.org</a>. This is going to a historical move. Now, it's even possible to run Swift in Windows compilers, TV and variety of embedded systems. Sound familiar? Yes, that's what Java language is trying to fit into. Presumably, Swift is going to be a new generation of <a href="http://java.com/en/download/whatis_java.jsp" target="_blank">Java</a>. Oh man, Apple is ambitious!</p>
<h2>Adapt it!</h2>
<p>Swift for me or most of us is still mysterious world. I am not saying that Objective-C is solid and we should stick with it. Of course, I don't suggest all of us to go for Swift insanely. As time goes by, one better thing is going to replace another because of evolution. We all do. Sometimes, things are too tough to change. What should we do then? We don't adopt but adapting from now on.</p>
