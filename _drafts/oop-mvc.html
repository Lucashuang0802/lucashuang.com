<p>Have you ever been in a situation when you found so tough to fix a bug, even not being able to address what's the actual problem is except for the causes developers can't control like errors from system and library? Sometimes, you need to fix numerous places which you could have been simplified. Or, it takes a longer time to locate that specific portion of the codes. If so, you probably have some troubles on how you architect and apply a certain design pattern to your project correctly.</p>
<p>You probably have thought about refactoring it. In fact, it's not a bad sign if you have realized before. But, time for developers is always so limited. On the other hand, refactoring is something that can't be done in a day or two. The only way to get rid of this dilemma is to build a great foundation from day one. I have been working on a variety of iOS applications for four years so I am going to use an iOS app as a showcase. Whatever software applications implementing user interfaces on computers could be applied by this fundamental principle combination: OOP+MVC. Actually, the goal is simple: write READABLE, MAINTAINABLE and TESTABLE codes. BTW, I chose MVC pattern just because it's classic. Other software architecture patterns like MVP and MVVM are more effective to implement certain functionalities to some extent.</p>
<p>You may ask: what's the difference between OOP and MVC. This is also the question I asked myself when I wrote this article. From my understanding: MVC pattern helps separate and organize files in a meaningful manner for developing UI applications. It's not incorrect to say MVC pattern is applied on the application level. As for OOP, it's a general programming paradigm in order to describe data and procedure more like objects in real world. I believe this one is not strange, it's why OOP was introduced.This sounds a bit irrelated. Perhaps giving an example is better: <strong>UIButton</strong>. Most likely, you will use a <strong>UIButton</strong> or develop a new button class inherited from <strong>UIButton</strong> in a view component based on MVC pattern. Regarding OOP, let's list it based on its attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encapsulation: <strong>UIButton</strong> is developed based on OOP principle. Property <strong><em>currentTitle</em></strong> encapsulates the text appearing on the button regardless of state. Another example with visibility is <em><strong>buttonType</strong></em>, it's a read-only property that does not allow to change after initialization.</li>
<li>Inheritance: <strong>UIButton </strong>inherits from class UIControl therefore, it has the ability to interact with users from the touch screen.</li>
<li>Polymorphism: <em><strong>layoutIfNeeded </strong></em>will act differently from an instance of <strong>UIButton </strong>and an instance of <strong>UITableView</strong>. However, both of the purposes is to force laying out the view subtree starting at the root.</li>
<li>Abstraction: <strong>UIButton </strong>conforms <strong>NSCoding</strong> protocol<strong> </strong>perhaps for some internal development.</li>
</ul>
<p>We start seeing a point to differentiate OOP and MVC so far: whether it's applied on the application level. Unfortunately, it's not entirely true. On the application level, OOP can happen anytime and anywhere but it's just hard to aware of. Let's take a look at this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uw0r1fr6rqqmx3e/MVC-Demo-Finish.zip?dl=0">finished sample app</a> originated from my previous post: <a href="https://lucaashuang.wordpress.com/2016/03/30/mvc-ios/">What is MVC in practice?</a> using the intuitive approach again: listing!</p>
